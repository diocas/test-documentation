# Switch to a new configuration

Did you select the option to always start the same configuration but you need a different one?
<br>Do you want to restart your session and/or select a new configuration?

To do these, you can go to the top right menu and click "Change configuration". This will stop your session and take you
back to the configuration menu. But, by doing so, your saved configuration will be lost.

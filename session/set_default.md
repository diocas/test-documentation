# Set a configuration as default

If you do not want to select a configuration every time you want to start a session, you can tick the 
"Always start with this configuration" check box. By doing this, SWAN will save the configuration chosen, and use this
whenever necessary.

If you have problems when starting your session due to this option, please remove from your CERNBox the hidden file named
".swanrc", that is located inside the folder _SWAN_projects_.

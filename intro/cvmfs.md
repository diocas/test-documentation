# Software: CVMFS

[CVMFS](https://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem) (CernVM File System) is a software distribution service.

SWAN uses CVMFS to access collections of software, called LCG releases. An LCG Release is a set of several (~200) software packages 
consistently built together. The elements of a particular LCG release can be inspected [here](http://lcginfo.cern.ch/).

CVMFS is also the way some LHC experiments distribute their software and therefore accessible through SWAN.

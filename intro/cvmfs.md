# Software: CVMFS

[CVMFS](https://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem) (CernVM File System) is CERN's software distribution service. 
SWAN uses CVMFS to access collections of software, called LCG releases. An LCG Release is a set of several (~200) software packages 
consistently built together.
 
If you want tk know what packages, and corresponding versions, are available in each release, please check the 
[LCG info page](http://lcginfo.cern.ch/).

CVMFS is also the way some LHC experiments distribute their software and, therefore, it is also accessible through SWAN.
